			<p>My name is Prayan Piya and I currently am a second year student here at Herald College Kathmandu studying B.Sc.(hons.) Computer Science. I am 19 and I aspire to be a professional Game Developer after my studies.Having completed my +2 studies from NSS (National School of Sciences) with an GPA of 3.55, I always knew I would work in Tech whatsoever.Game Development was a passion I found through my friends as we would always be talking about games and I was always interested in how my favourite games were made.</p>

			<p>Nobigo is a Gamified Language Learning app which I had worked on under my 3 months internship peroid at Dark Matter Game Productions.Nobigo is designed to help Nepali learners quickly grasp practical Japanese. It teaches Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji through interactive tracing, builds essential vocabulary and grammar, and guides users through a structured path suited for studying, working, or daily life in Japan. Features like a built-in Resume Builder also help students and workers prepare for opportunities in Japan.</p>

			<p>Shark Attack Simulation is a game I had worked on along with my collegue as a part of our academic coursework for the module "Interactive 3D Applications". We can play both as a person and as a shark in the game, while playing as a person our main objective is to reach to the island safely without getting eaten by the shark  whereas while playing as the shark our objective is to kill three persons whilst on water to win the game.I handled the Game UI,game logic,QA Testing and various other aspects of the game.</p>
